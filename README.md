# JSON-Sniff
A small Javascript project to help pentest websites, this overrides the JSON api which most if not all websites that use any sort of JSON uses.

# What does this do?
In theory without procautions by a website this allows vunerabilies that we're not typically thought of prior to this release, this makes it so anything in the JSON library can be modified to the point of a security breach on some websites.

This screenshot shows [webcrack](https://webcrack.netlify.app/)'s use of the JSON library.

# DISCLAIMER
This is only for pentesters if you are not a security profensional who is using this for its intended purpose and not just a hacker please carry on if not then I beg you to leave this, its not complicated but it can be very harmful.
